Hello, and welcome to the development of GalTalk, an open-source, visual-novel development plugin for the Godot engine. GalTalk offers a friendly, 
localized interface for users of all languages, enabling creators with no programming background to build visual novels through simple, intuitive visual tools. Of course, 
if you already know Godot, you can also integrate GalTalk into your own projects to present your story.
When using GalTalk in a project, please clearly inform users that the project utilizes GalTalk—such as in the splash screen or the credits section. 
GalTalk is currently in its early stages of development; we warmly welcome everyone to try it out and share their feedback. Thank you all!


你好，欢迎使用或参与Godot开源可视化视觉小说开发插件项目GalTalk的开发，GalTalk为不同语言的用户提供友好的当地语言开发界面和简单易用的可视化开发，
使得不会编程的开发者也能够开发视觉小说，当然如果你会godot也可以将GalTalk用于你的项目来展现剧情。
请在使用GalTalk的项目中明确告诉用户该项目使用了GalTalk（如启动界面，鸣谢......），
GalTalk目前还处于早期开发阶段，欢迎大家的使用与反馈，谢谢大家。
